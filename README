DESCRIPTION:

This is project contains two parts, client and server. 
Clietn is small board on Atmega48 + IA4421 transceiver + DS18S20 temperature sensor, powered from 3 AA battery. Client stays in deep sleep all time, but one of 1 minutes it wakeup, gets temperature, sends it to server and goes sleep again. One time of 10 minutes it get (with ADC) battery voltage, and sends it to server too.
Server board is the same except DS18S20 sensor, it always listens for client data, and put it through UART (i use UART to USB converter).

For IA4421 i use git@github.com:flukso/rfm12.git library (master branch), but it does not give any methods for put IA4421 deep sleep, so i add hack to my code with direct write to transceiver register to disable RX and TX. Also i remove nested interrupt flag from interrupt function prototype, otherwise i have many trubles with transceiver.

Now, client power consuption in deep sleep mode about 2-4 microAmpers (x10^-6 A), my multimetr is not so precision and lays, i think ))

BOARD:

I use custom prebuild boards without src files, so it is not interresting to publish it here.
Schematic very simple with direct powering board from battery without any converting (IA4421 powering voltage diapason is 3.6 to 2.5, but it work fine with 4.5 to 2.5)

FLASH MC:

flash atmega48 with command (for ft2232 based programmer), client for example
	avreal +ATmega48 -aft2232:enable=adbus4 -pd="Dual RS232 A" -ew -v -c client.hex
